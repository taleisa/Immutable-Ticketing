# Immutable-Ticketing

The immutable ticketing system is our capstone project at Alfaisal university.

The goal of the system is to eliminate the black market of tickets.This goal can be acheived using blockchain technology. Tickets are NFT's meaning they can neither be forged or sold to more than one person.
This system is built using the etheruem public blockchain
